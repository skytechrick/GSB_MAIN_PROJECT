How to check
I have all the server part in the backend.

And all the files like jws css images documents in the Files folder and served images folder

Open the project in the terminal

Then go inside the directory in the backend using "cd Backend" command

Then run the server using "npm run server" and check go to the localhost or http://127.0.0.1:80 to any browser

Then you can check the files.
